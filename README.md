# TOP_MemoryGame
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) JavaScript curriculum. 

## Description
The goal of this project was to build a memory game from scratch using React. It requires an internet connection due to the
curriculum's direction to utilize an API to generate the images.

## Rules
The game consists of selecting all the Pokemon cards without selecting the same one twice. The game initially generates 4
different cards, which are reshuffled after each selection. If the player successfully picks all 4 cards, a new group of 
Pokemon is generated with two additional cards for difficulty. Upon reselection of a card, the game is over and the high score is recorded.
